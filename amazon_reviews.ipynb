Best warranty listed anywhere, and hopefully will not need, but for the price you cannot beat this deal.PRO\\'s  Very bright, good OSD, easy to set up, plug and play, registered and using same day as delivered.CONS\\'s  Does NOT come with a user manual (NO how to use/set OSD settings, specifications of the monitor, recommended settings, etc.  The \"Important Information Manual\" has 65 pages with 5 pages in English that have no useful information for the monitor) Had to google search to verify the listing specs and still have not found a PDF for \"How to set up settings via OSD\" for the recommend use and the effects of each setting, especially the low blue mode. The PDF files on the listing are for a different model, and one is for a coffee pot!!  But did verify that the listed specs are legit.  Bought this as an upgrade and to be able to see the screen at a normal distance with my glasses but had to change settings to a 1360 X 1024 from the default of 1920 X 1080 as that setting was too small for me to read and would only occupy 80% of the screen.  I am full screen at the changed setting.  Would like to have more information about the settings via OSD (On Screen Display), but overall, very happy with this monitor and recommend for anyone wanting to upgrade an older desktop PC (or laptop) at an awesome price and best warranty listed!!PS I\\'m NOT a gamer, general use, research, FB, Email, bill pay and movies :)) Hence the no rating for gaming :)) But, my 2GB video card looks pretty awesome also and better colors than my old 20\" monitor.  When I upgrade my Desktop will use this monitor as a secondary/dual monitor set up!',\n",

Its 75Hz refresh rate ensures smooth performance, making it ideal for tasks ranging from document editing to watching videos. The monitor's HDMI and VGA ports provide easy connectivity, and the VESA mount compatibility allows for flexible positioning.Setting up the monitor is straightforward, and it works seamlessly with both PC and Mac systems. The bright display and good on-screen display (OSD) settings enhance the user experience. However, the lack of a comprehensive user manual can be a drawback, requiring users to search online for setup information.The monitor's eye protection feature helps reduce fatigue during long hours of use, and the stylish bezel-free design fits well in any environment. The 4-year advance replacement warranty is an excellent bonus, offering peace of mind for a durable and reliable product.\",\n",
